    <ul>
      <li>
        Infrastructure engineer supporting Stripe's core compute platform, cloud
        networking, and high availability and disaster recovery. Supported a
        Kubernetes cluster running scheduled jobs which moved substantially all
        of Stripe's money. Helped build a compute platform to run web services on
        top of Kubernetes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Built a control plane to deliver Envoy Proxy configuration to thousands of
        servers. Supported the Envoy data plane processing hundreds of thousands
        of requests per second, including all of Stripe's API and online database
        traffic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Founding member of the high availability and disaster recovery team,
        comprising some of the most trusted and experienced engineers at Stripe.
        Over the course of 18 months, we built a new disaster recovery system
        that allowed Stripe to run APIs and services across multiple physical
        regions and multiple countries. Regularly exercised the regional failover
        system against production traffic to ensure its reliability without
        impacting customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Instrumented Stripe's core database libraries to determine when database
        operations were likely to cross regional boundaries. This work formed
        the core metrics to measure Stripe's ability to recover from a regional
        outage and run performantly in a multi-region configuration. Named on a
        patent for this work.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shaved hundreds of milliseconds off of the tail latency of Stripe's API
        by implementing a new architecture for routing Stripe API requests to the
        backend.

    <p>Intern the Haystack/F4 team responsible for extabyte scale storage automation.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Developed a new trash collector for Facebook's primary BLOB storage system
        reclaiming petabytes of space daily. Improved upon the existing trash
        collector by decreasing the runtime of the process from 15 hours to 20
        minutes.
