    <p>
      Infrastructure engineer supporting Stripe's core compute platform, cloud
      networking, and high availability and disaster recovery. Supported a
      Kubernetes cluster running scheduled jobs which moved substantially all
      of Stripe's money. Helped build a compute platform to run web services on
      top of Kubernetes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Built a control plane to deliver Envoy Proxy configuration to thousands
      of servers to process hundreds of thousands of requests per second,
      including all of Stripe's API and online database traffic. Supported the
      Envoy data plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Founding member of the high availability and disaster recovery team,
      comprising some of the most trusted and experienced engineers at Stripe.
      Over the course of 18 months, we built a new disaster recovery system
      that allowed Stripe to run APIs and services across multiple physical
      regions and multiple countries. Regularly exercised the regional failover
      system against production traffic to ensure its reliability without
      impacting customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shaved hundreds of milliseconds off of the tail latency of Stripe's API
      by implementing a new architecture for routing Stripe API requests to the
      backend.

    <p>Intern the Haystack/F4 team responsible for extabyte scale storage automation.

      Developed a new trash collector for Facebook's primary BLOB storage system
      reclaiming petabytes of space daily. Improved upon the existing trash

      minutes.
